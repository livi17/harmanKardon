<p>Hit the power button and watch as this receiver comes to life!</p>

<p>What exactly did I do here?</p>
<p>I reverse engineered my own 1982 Harman Kardon 590i receiver as a Google Chrome experiment, utilizing technologies like <i><b>Less, JavaScript, HTML5, Google Web Fonts, streaming audio</b></i>, and the <i><b>JavaScript Web Audio API</b></i> to replicate the real-life receiver's functionality.</p>

<p>The interface is constructed almost entirely in CSS and HTML5, and matched as closely as possible to the real thing. A very small css sprite image was used to create the digital font in the electronic display. Go ahead, have a look at the source code!<br>
</p>

<p>As mentioned, this is a Google Chrome experiment. Due to patent issues, the formats of the streaming audio sources will not work in the Firefox browser.</p> 

<p>Speaking of the streaming audio sources... those are real live readio stations that you are hearing as you scan through the channels in AM or FM mode.</p>

<p>Hear something you like? Go ahead and save it as a preset by hitting the memory button, and then selecting a preset button.</p>

<p>Is it all about that bass? Then turn up that bass dial! Set the treble and balance where you would like it.</p>

<p>The bass/treble and tone defeat functions allow you to customize your sound, or bypass the bass and treble dials altogether</p>
